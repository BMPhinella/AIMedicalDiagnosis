# AIMedicalDiagnosis
The challenge of insufficient medical doctors in health facilities in Uganda has increasingly become a problem over the years. 
This problem has birthed many other challenges that have made it almost impossible for Ugandans to access quality and prompt medical services.
In order to solve this problem, we are have proposed an Intelligent Medical Diagnostic tool that will help medical practitioners to classify diseases with minimal human interaction. 
The system shall make a prognosis of what the patient may be suffering from in reference to the latterâ€™s signs and symptoms, and recommend the appropriate laboratory tests to be done.
